        <h2>Few important notes about Construction Engineering:</h2>
        <ol><strong><em>1.Construction engineering</em></strong> </ol>
        <ol> Construction engineering is a professional discipline that deals with the designing, planning, construction
            and management of infrastructures such as roads, tunnels, bridges, airports, railroads, facilities,
            buildings, dams, utilities and other projects.</ol>
        <ol><strong><em>2.Work activities </em></strong></ol>
        <ol>Being a sub-discipline of Civil Engineering, construction Engineers apply their knowledge and business,
            technical and management skills obtained from their undergraduate degree to oversee projects that include
            bridges, buildings and housing projects. Construction Engineers are heavily involved in the design and
            management/ allocation of funds in these projects. They are charged with risk analysis, costing and
            planning.</ol>
        <ol><strong><em>3.Abilities </em></strong></ol>
        <ol>Construction engineers are problem solvers. They contribute to the creation of infrastructure that best
            meets the unique demands of its environment. They must be able to understand infrastructure life cycles.
            When compared and contrasted to design engineers, construction engineers bring to the table their own unique
            perspectives for solving technical challenges with clarity and imagination. While individuals considering
            this career path should certainly have a strong understanding of mathematics and science, many other skills
            are also highly desirable, including critical and analytical thinking, time management, people management
            and good communication skills.</ol>
