        <p>Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement
            (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after
            water,and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of
            steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.</p>

        <header>Etymology</header>
        <p>The word concrete comes from the Latin word "concretus" (meaning compact or condensed), the perfect passive
            participle of "concrescere", from "con-" (together) and "crescere" (to grow).</p>

        <header>History</header>
        <h3>Ancient times</h3>
        <p>Mayan concrete at the ruins of Uxmal is referenced in Incidents of Travel in the Yucatán by John L. Stephens.
            "The roof is flat and had been covered with cement". "The floors were cement, in some places hard, but, by
            long exposure, broken, and now crumbling under the feet." "But throughout the wall was solid, and consisting
            of large stones imbedded in mortar, almost as hard as rock."</p>
        <p>Small-scale production of concrete-like materials was pioneered by the Nabatean traders who occupied and
            controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern
            Jordan from the 4th century BC. They discovered the advantages of hydraulic lime, with some self-cementing
            properties, by 700 BC. They built kilns to supply mortar for the construction of rubble masonry houses,
            concrete floors, and underground waterproof cisterns. They kept the cisterns secret as these enabled the
            Nabataeans to thrive in the desert. Some of these structures survive to this day.</p>
        <h3>Classical era</h3>
        <p>In the Ancient Egyptian and later Roman eras, builders discovered that adding volcanic ash to the mix allowed
            it to set underwater.</p>
        <p>Concrete floors were found in the royal palace of Tiryns, Greece, which dates roughly to 1400–1200 BC. Lime
            mortars were used in Greece, Crete, and Cyprus in 800 BC. The Assyrian Jerwan Aqueduct (688 BC) made use of
            waterproof concrete. Concrete was used for construction in many ancient structures.</p>
        <p>The Romans used concrete extensively from 300 BC to 476 AD. During the Roman Empire, Roman concrete (or opus
            caementicium) was made from quicklime, pozzolana and an aggregate of pumice. Its widespread use in many
            Roman structures, a key event in the history of architecture termed the Roman architectural revolution,
            freed Roman construction from the restrictions of stone and brick materials. It enabled revolutionary new
            designs in terms of both structural complexity and dimension. The Colosseum in Rome was built largely of
            concrete, and the concrete dome of the Pantheon is the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.</p>
        <p>Concrete, as the Romans knew it, was a new and revolutionary material. Laid in the shape of arches, vaults
            and domes, it quickly hardened into a rigid mass, free from many of the internal thrusts and strains that
            troubled the builders of similar structures in stone or brick.</p>
        <p>Modern tests show that opus caementicium had as much compressive strength as modern Portland-cement concrete
            (ca. 200 kg/cm2 [20 MPa; 2,800 psi]). However, due to the absence of reinforcement, its tensile strength was
            far lower than modern reinforced concrete, and its mode of application also differed:</p>
        <p>Modern structural concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency
            is fluid and homogeneous, allowing it to be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together
            with the placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of rubble. Second, integral
            reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could
            depend only upon the strength of the concrete bonding to resist tension.</p>
        <p>The long-term durability of Roman concrete structures has been found to be due to its use of pyroclastic
            (volcanic) rock and ash, whereby the crystallization of strätlingite (a specific and complex calcium
            aluminosilicate hydrate) and the coalescence of this and similar calcium–aluminum-silicate–hydrate cementing
            binders helped give the concrete a greater degree of fracture resistance even in seismically active
            environments. Roman concrete is significantly more resistant to erosion by seawater than modern concrete; it
            used pyroclastic materials which react with seawater to form Al-tobermorite crystals over time.</p>
        <p>The widespread use of concrete in many Roman structures ensured that many survive to the present day. The
            Baths of Caracalla in Rome are just one example. Many Roman aqueducts and bridges, such as the magnificent
            Pont du Gard in southern France, have masonry cladding on a concrete core, as does the dome of the Pantheon.
        </p>
        <p>After the Roman Empire collapsed, use of concrete became rare until the technology was redeveloped in the
            mid-18th century. Worldwide, concrete has overtaken steel in tonnage of material used.</p>
        <h3>Middle Ages</h3>
        <p>After the Roman Empire, the use of burned lime and pozzolana was greatly reduced. Low kiln temperatures in
            the burning of lime, lack of pozzolana, and poor mixing all contributed to a decline in the quality of
            concrete and mortar. From the 11th century, the increased use of stone in church and castle construction led
            to an increased demand for mortar. Quality began to improve in the 12th century through better grinding and
            sieving. Medieval lime mortars and concretes were non-hydraulic and were used for binding masonry,
            "hearting" (binding rubble masonry cores) and foundations. Bartholomaeus Anglicus in his De proprietatibus
            rerum (1240) describes the making of mortar. In an English translation from 1397, it reads "lyme ... is a
            stone brent; by medlynge thereof with sonde and water sement is made". From the 14th century, the quality of
            mortar was again excellent, but only from the 17th century was pozzolana commonly added.</p>
        <p>The Canal du Midi was built using concrete in 1670.</p>
        <h3>Industrial era</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the greatest step forward in the modern use of concrete was Smeaton's Tower, built by British
            engineer John Smeaton in Devon, England, between 1756 and 1759. This third Eddystone Lighthouse pioneered
            the use of hydraulic lime in concrete, using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate.</p>
        <p>A method for producing Portland cement was developed in England and patented by Joseph Aspdin in 1824. Aspdin
            chose the name for its similarity to Portland stone, which was quarried on the Isle of Portland in Dorset,
            England. His son William continued developments into the 1840s, earning him recognition for the development
            of "modern" Portland cement.</p>
        <p>Reinforced concrete was invented in 1849 by Joseph Monier and the first reinforced concrete house was built
            by François Coignet[37] in 1853. The first concrete reinforced bridge was designed and built by Joseph
            Monier in 1875.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Composition">
        <header>Composition</header>
        <p>Concrete is an artificial composite material, comprising a matrix of cementitious binder (typically Portland
            cement paste or asphalt) and a dispersed phase or "filler" of aggregate (typically a rocky material, loose
            stones, and sand). The binder "glues" the filler together to form a synthetic conglomerate. Many types of
            concrete are available, determined by the formulations of binders and the types of aggregate used to suit
            the application of the engineered material. These variables determine strength and density, as well as
            chemical and thermal resistance of the finished product.</p>
        <p>Cement paste, most commonly made of Portland cement, is the most prevalent kind of concrete binder. For
            cementitious binders, water is mixed with the dry cement powder and aggregate, which produces a semi-liquid
            slurry (paste) that can be shaped, typically by pouring it into a form. The concrete solidifies and hardens
            through a chemical process called hydration. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other
            components together, creating a robust, stone-like material. Other cementitious materials, such as fly ash
            and slag cement, are sometimes added—either pre-blended with the cement or directly as a concrete
            component—and become a part of the binder for the aggregate. Fly ash and slag can enhance some properties of
            concrete such as fresh properties and durability. Alternatively, other materials can also be used as a
            concrete binder: the most prevalent substitute is asphalt, which is used as the binder in asphalt concrete.
        </p>
        <p>Admixtures are added to modify the cure rate or properties of the material. Mineral admixtures use recycled
            materials as concrete ingredients. Conspicuous materials include fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power
            plants; ground granulated blast furnace slag, a by-product of steelmaking; and silica fume, a by-product of
            industrial electric arc furnaces.</p>
        <p>Structures employing Portland cement concrete usually include steel reinforcement because this type of
            concrete can be formulated with high compressive strength, but always has lower tensile strength. Therefore,
            it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension, typically steel rebar.</p>
        <p>The mix design depends on the type of structure being built, how the concrete is mixed and delivered, and how
            it is placed to form the structure.</p>
        <h3>Cement</h3>
        <p>Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete,
            mortar, and many plasters.</p>
        <p>British masonry worker Joseph Aspdin patented Portland cement in 1824. It was named because of the similarity
            of its color to Portland limestone, quarried from the English Isle of Portland and used extensively in
            London architecture. It consists of a mixture of calcium silicates (alite, belite), aluminates and
            ferrites—compounds which combine calcium, silicon, aluminum and iron in forms which will react with water.
        </p>
        <p>Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating limestone (a source of calcium) with clay or shale
            (a source of silicon, aluminum and iron) and grinding this product (called clinker) with a source of sulfate
            (most commonly gypsum).</p>
        <p>In modern cement kilns, many advanced features are used to lower the fuel consumption per ton of clinker
            produced. Cement kilns are extremely large, complex, and inherently dusty industrial installations, and have
            emissions which must be controlled. Of the various ingredients used to produce a given quantity of concrete,
            the cement is the most energetically expensive. Even complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6
            gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then grind it into cement. Many kilns can be fueled
            with difficult-to-dispose-of wastes, the most common being used tires. The extremely high temperatures and
            long periods of time at those temperatures allows cement kilns to efficiently and completely burn even
            difficult-to-use fuels.</p>
        <h3>Water</h3>
        <p>Combining water with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the process of hydration. The cement
            paste glues the aggregate together, fills voids within it, and makes it flow more freely.</p>
        <p>As stated by Abrams' law, a lower water-to-cement ratio yields a stronger, more durable concrete, whereas
            more water gives a freer-flowing concrete with a higher slump. Impure water used to make concrete can cause
            problems when setting or in causing premature failure of the structure.</p>
        <p>Portland cement consists of five major compounds of calcium silicates and alumninates ranging from 5 to 50%
            in weight, which all undergo hydration to contribute to final material's strength. Thus, the hydration of
            cement involves many reactions, often occurring at the same time. As the reactions proceed, the products of
            the cement hydration process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles and other
            components of the concrete to form a solid mass.</p>
        <h3>Aggregates</h3>
        <p>Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. Sand, natural gravel, and crushed stone
            are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition, and excavation waste)
            are increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates, while a number of manufactured
            aggregates, including air-cooled blast furnace slag and bottom ash are also permitted.</p>
        <p>The size distribution of the aggregate determines how much binder is required. Aggregate with a very even
            size distribution has the biggest gaps whereas adding aggregate with smaller particles tends to fill these
            gaps. The binder must fill the gaps between the aggregate as well as paste the surfaces of the aggregate
            together, and is typically the most expensive component. Thus, variation in sizes of the aggregate reduces
            the cost of concrete. The aggregate is nearly always stronger than the binder, so its use does not
            negatively affect the strength of the concrete.</p>
        <p>Redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates non-homogeneity due to the influence of
            vibration. This can lead to strength gradients.</p>
        <p>Decorative stones such as quartzite, small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface
            of concrete for a decorative "exposed aggregate" finish, popular among landscape designers.</p>
        <h3>Admixtures</h3>
        <p>Admixtures are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the concrete to give it certain
            characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes. Admixtures are defined as additions "made as the
            concrete mix is being prepared". The most common admixtures are retarders and accelerators. In normal use,
            admixture dosages are less than 5% by mass of cement and are added to the concrete at the time of
            batching/mixing. (See § Production below.) The common types of admixtures[52] are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accelerators</strong> speed up the hydration (hardening) of the concrete.</li>
            <li><strong>Air entraining</strong> agents add and entrain tiny air bubbles in the concrete, which reduces
                damage during freeze-thaw cycles, increasing durability.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonding agents </strong> are used to create a bond between old and new concrete (typically a
                type of polymer) with wide temperature tolerance and corrosion resistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Corrosion inhibitors</strong> are used to minimize the corrosion of steel and steel bars in
                concrete.</li>
            <li><strong>Crystalline admixtures</strong> are typically added during batching of the concrete to lower
                permeability.</li>
            <li><strong>Pigments</strong> can be used to change the color of concrete, for aesthetics.</li>
            <li><strong>Plasticizers</strong> increase the workability of plastic, or "fresh", concrete, allowing it to
                be placed more easily, with less consolidating effort.</li>
            <li><strong>Superplasticizers</strong> (also called high-range water-reducers) are a class of plasticizers
                that have fewer deleterious effects and can be used to increase workability more than is practical with
                traditional plasticizers.</li>
            <li><strong>Pumping</strong> aids improve pumpability, thicken the paste and reduce separation and bleeding.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Retarders</strong> slow the hydration of concrete and are used in large or difficult pours where
                partial setting is undesirable before completion of the pour.</li>
            <h3>Mineral admixtures and blended cements</h3>
            <p>Inorganic materials that have pozzolanic or latent hydraulic properties, these very fine-grained
                materials are added to the concrete mix to improve the properties of concrete (mineral admixtures), or
                as a replacement for Portland cement (blended cements). Products which incorporate limestone, fly ash,
                blast furnace slag, and other useful materials with pozzolanic properties into the mix, are being tested
                and used. These developments are ever growing in relevance to minimize the impacts caused by cement use,
                notorious for being one of the largest producers (at about 5 to 10%) of global greenhouse gas emissions.
                The use of alternative materials also is capable of lowering costs, improving concrete properties, and
                recycling wastes, the latest being relevant for Circular Economy aspects of the construction industry,
                whose demand is ever growing with greater impacts on raw material extraction, waste generation and
                landfill practices.</p>

        <header>Production</header>
        <p>Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients—water, aggregate, cement, and
            any additives—to produce concrete. Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed,
            workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens. In modern usage, most concrete production takes
            place in a large type of industrial facility called a concrete plant, or often a batch plant.</p>
        <p>In general usage, concrete plants come in two main types, ready mix plants and central mix plants. A
            ready-mix plant mixes all the ingredients except water, while a central mix plant mixes all the ingredients
            including water. A central-mix plant offers more accurate control of the concrete quality through better
            measurements of the amount of water added, but must be placed closer to the work site where the concrete
            will be used, since hydration begins at the plant.</p>
        <p>A concrete plant consists of large storage hoppers for various reactive ingredients like cement, storage for
            bulk ingredients like aggregate and water, mechanisms for the addition of various additives and amendments,
            machinery to accurately weigh, move, and mix some or all of those ingredients, and facilities to dispense
            the mixed concrete, often to a concrete mixer truck.</p>
        <p>Modern concrete is usually prepared as a viscous fluid, so that it may be poured into forms, which are
            containers erected in the field to give the concrete its desired shape. Concrete formwork can be prepared in
            several ways, such as slip forming and steel plate construction. Alternatively, concrete can be mixed into
            dryer, non-fluid forms and used in factory settings to manufacture precast concrete products.</p>
        <p>A wide variety of equipment is used for processing concrete, from hand tools to heavy industrial machinery.
            Whichever equipment builders use, however, the objective is to produce the desired building material;
            ingredients must be properly mixed, placed, shaped, and retained within time constraints. Any interruption
            in pouring the concrete can cause the initially placed material to begin to set before the next batch is
            added on top. This creates a horizontal plane of weakness called a cold joint between the two batches.[64]
            Once the mix is where it should be, the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete
            attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation, various technical details may affect the
            quality and nature of the product.</p>
